h1. Tree Run - A Suicidal Freeski Undertaking


h2. "History"

This little game was written for a game programming contest. As the contest finished (after 3 hours) the following functionality was implemented:

- 2 skiers independently controllable
- Random landscape/hills to ski
- Collision with trees
- A simple points system

(See commit http://github.com/severin/tree_run/commit/e71601b68ba5ad9628436a2f3605675514ca4c03)



h2. What's next?

The code needs some polishing, the game should be restartable, highscores should be saved, a single-player mode would be nice, different undergrounds would be cool (ice, deep powder etc.), maybe some obstacles (rocks, cliffs) to jump over and get style points...
You see, there's plenty to do :)
